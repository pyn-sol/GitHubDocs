Issues:
- \__init__ looks weird in TOC  (doesn't happen on local...)
- check out psf/requests code. Something breaks the code block on tab. Can we support this?
- some repos disable the left column navigation, need more research on this
- on authorization() redirect, we always go to index - can we go back to where we came from?

Features:
- notify when code copied (toast?)
- add more robust support for .rst
- button to view raw code file for each page
- allow manual triggering of light/dark mode (currently system default)

Style Improvements:
- style admonitions better
- there's a little bit of wiggle in content on mobile
- codeblocks in light-mode could be more visually appealing
- on toc link click, class label gets shifted down into method name
- Repo Search needs a style overhaul

## Using GitHub Docs
While on the main page for a repo, https://github.com/owner/repo, just add 'docs' to the url, like so: https://githubdocs.com/owner/repo


## What is turned into Documentation?
The following filetypes are currently supported:  

- .md
- .rst
- .txt
- .py

Any other files will be ignored and not included in the navigation. Markdown files are rendered through the [Markdown](https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown) library and Python files are converted to markdown on the fly using [Rubberdoc](https://github.com/pyn-sol/rubberdoc).
